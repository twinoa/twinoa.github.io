## 621. Task Scheduler
### 문제 링크
<https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/description/>

### 문제 설명
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

​Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

### 제한 사항
- 1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4
- tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
- 0 <= n <= 100

#### 입출력 예 #1 
1. **Input** : tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
2. **Output** : 8
3. **Explanation** : A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

#### 입출력 예 #2 
1. **Input** : tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
2. **Output** : 6
3. **Explanation** : A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

#### 입출력 예 #3
1. **Input** : tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
2. **Output** : 10
3. **Explanation** : A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

### 문제 풀이
Counter 모듈을 이용하여 문제를 풀이할 수 있다.


```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        counter = collections.Counter(tasks)
        result = 0

        while True:
            sub_count = 0
            # 개수 순 추출
            for task, _ in counter.most_common(n + 1):
                sub_count += 1
                result += 1

                counter.subtract(task)
                # 0 이하인 아이템을 목록에서 완전히 제거
                counter += collections.Counter()

            if not counter:
                break

            result += n - sub_count + 1

        return result
```
