## 455. Assign Cookies
### 문제 링크
<https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/description/>

### 문제 설명
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

### 제한 사항
- 1 <= g.length <= 3 * 10^4
- 0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4
- 1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 2^31 - 1

#### 입출력 예 #1 
1. **Input** : g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
2. **Output** : 1
3. **Explanation** : You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.

#### 입출력 예 #2 
1. **Input** : g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
2. **Output** : 2
3. **Explanation** : You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

### 문제 풀이
1. 그리디 알고리즘
2. 이진 검색


```python
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        g.sort()
        s.sort()

        child_i = cookie_j = 0
        # 만족하지 못할 때까지 그리디 진행
        while child_i < len(g) and cookie_j < len(s):
            if s[cookie_j] >= g[child_i]:
                child_i += 1
            cookie_j += 1

        return child_i
```


```python
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        g.sort()
        s.sort()

        result = 0
        for i in s:
            # 이진 검색으로 더 큰 인덱스 탐색
            index = bisect.bisect_right(g, i)
            if index > result:
                result += 1
        return result
```
